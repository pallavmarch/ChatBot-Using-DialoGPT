# ChatBot-Using-DialoGPT
A simple and interactive ChatBot built using Microsoft's DialoGPT model. This ChatBot can engage in conversations, respond to user inputs, and provide fallback responses when it does not understand the input. The project demonstrates the use of the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement a conversational AI model.
